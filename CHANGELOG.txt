== Changelog ==

= 8.1.7 01/26/2015 =
* BUG: Fix bug which was stripping numeric characters from the entry name when it was being displayed.
* BUG: Fix bug where category slugs were not being quoted which cause querying by category slug to fail.
* TWEAK: Cleanup logic in cnEntry::setFamilyMembers().
* TWEAK: Cleanup/refactor the methods that get the entry name fields in cnEntry.

* OTHER: Introduce cnSanitize::field().
* OTHER: Fix a phpDoc errors.

= 8.1.6 01/21/2015 =
* BUG: Fixed the “Warning: Cannot use a scalar value as an array” error. This error was shown to users when their web host does not have an image processing library installed on the web server. This error should no longer be shown, however, Connections will not be able to dynamically resize images. A notice in the admin will still be displayed, “The server does not have ImageMagick or GD installed and/or enabled. Either of these are required for WordPress to be able to resize images. Please contact your server administrator.” If you see this notice, you will have to contact your web host and request that they install the GD image processing library.
* BUG: White screen when uploading an image. This, I believe, is being caused by an older version of the Imagick image processing library. The older version does not contain a required function and will cause a fatal error when Connections tries to use it. This causes the white screen. To address this, Connections no longer uses that function.
* BUG: Fix bug with image URL/s when the protocol is https so they are served securely.
* BUG: Fix bug that would copy any images from the `connections-images` folder to the {entry-slug} folder when adding an entry.

Since it is now being prepended with a forward slash both path and url needed to be untrailingslashit() so the paths are correct when the two are joined with subdir().
