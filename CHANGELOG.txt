* BUG: Fixed the “Warning: Cannot use a scalar value as an array” error. This error was shown to users when their web host does not have an image processing library installed on the web server. This error should no longer be shown, however, Connections will not be able to dynamically resize images. A notice in the admin will still be displayed, “The server does not have ImageMagick or GD installed and/or enabled. Either of these are required for WordPress to be able to resize images. Please contact your server administrator.” If you see this notice, you will have to contact your web host and request that they install the GD image processing library.
* BUG: White screen when uploading an image. This, I believe, is being caused by an older version of the Imagick image processing library.

This was done to remain consistent with WP core.
