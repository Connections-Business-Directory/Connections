Its simplicity in design and function, vast array of unique features and versatility are the reasons more and more people are turning to Connections for their directory needs. You can use Connections to create a simple address book, maintain a staff directory and run a business directory or link directory.

= 8.1.6 01/21/2015 =
* BUG: Fixed the “Warning: Cannot use a scalar value as an array” error. This error was shown to users when their web host does not have an image processing library installed on the web server. This error should no longer be shown, however, Connections will not be able to dynamically resize images. A notice in the admin will still be displayed, “The server does not have ImageMagick or GD installed and/or enabled. Either of these are required for WordPress to be able to resize images. Please contact your server administrator.” If you see this notice, you will have to contact your web host and request that they install the GD image processing library.
* BUG: White screen when uploading an image. This, I believe, is being caused by an older version of the Imagick image processing library. The older version does not contain a required function and will cause a fatal error when Connections tries to use it. This causes the white screen.

* BUG: Show the edit entry admin bar link if the entry status is approved or pending if the user has either edit or edit moderated capabilities.
* BUG: Fix undefined index errors.
* TWEAK: Add input attribute accept=”image/*” to both the image and logo upload fields.
* TWEAK: Ensure that the path and URL to images are updated to the current path to account for moving sites or changing the site’s folder structure.
* TWEAK: Ensure sub dir is prefixed with a forward slash in cnUpload::subDirectory(). Since it is now being prepended with a forward slash both path and url needed to be untrailingslashit() so the paths are correct when the two are joined with subdir(). This was done to remain consistent with WP core.
* TWEAK: Prevent selection of files that are too large to be uploaded.
* TWEAK: Add actions/filters to cnImage::upload().
* TWEAK: Ensure other plugins can not override the upload path in cnUpload::File().
