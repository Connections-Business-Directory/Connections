Connections Business Directory is a simple to use directory plugin which can be used to create an addressbook, business directory, staff directory or church directory.

== Description ==

[Homepage](http://connections-pro.com/) | [Documentation](http://connections-pro.com/documentation/plugin/) | [Showcase](http://connections-pro.com/showcase/) | [Templates](http://connections-pro.com/templates/) | [Extensions](http://connections-pro.com/extensions/) | [Github](https://github.com/shazahm1/Connections)

Quite simply, Connections Business Directory is the best directory plugin available for WordPress. Its simplicity in design and function, vast array of unique features and versatility are the reasons more and more people are turning to Connections for their directory needs. You can use Connections to create a simple address book, maintain a staff directory and run a business directory or link directory. Connections was built bottom up to be as configurable as possible while providing the features you need. Read on to learn about some of the best features Connections has to offer...

= Features =
* Both the photo and logo images are fully responsive with HiDPI (Retina) display support.
* Seamless integration with the WordPress.
* A Dashboard admin page where you can keep up to date with Connections related news, such as updates notices for [templates](http://connections-pro.com/templates/) and the [Extensions](http://connections-pro.com/extensions/). Also see at a glance today's anniversaries and birthdays as well as any upcoming anniversaries and birthdays.
* When adding an entry there are multiple entry types from which to choose. They are individual, organization and family. The family entry type is unique to Connections. This entry type allows you to group individuals together as a family which makes Connections ideally suited for creating church directories.
* You control which entries are viewable to the public and which entries are private, viewable for logged in users only. You can even have entries set as unlisted so only admins can view them.
* Fields, fields and more fields... no other directory plugin offers more. There are fields for addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, IM, social networks, an image, a logo, bio, notes and more. Want more? Many fields, such as addresses and phone numbers, you can assign as many as you need. Wait, I'm not done yet... want to be able to list the business phone but keep that cell phone number private? You can do that, too. Most of the fields have selectable visibility. What this means is you can have an entry set as public but keep personal details private or even unlisted so only them admin can view it.
* Connections is being used to manage directories which contain tens of thousands of entries so the ability to manage them easily is a must- a task which Connections stands and delivers. You can filter the entries list by category, entry type and visibility. You can search for entries. You can even search within the filtered entries. Of course Connections doesn't stop there, there are several bulk actions available to make changes a breeze.
* Category support. This feature was modeled after the category feature for WordPress posts. So if you know how to add and manage categories for posts, you know how they work for Connections. Categories can be hierarchical and entries can be assigned to any number of categories.
* Extensive role capability support. For your users that have access to the WordPress admin, there is extensive role capability support. You can define which roles can perform tasks to manage entries in Connections.
* Unrivaled customization with templates. Connections comes with many basic templates to get you started. For many, these meet their needs. But if you need more than these basic templates provide, check out these great [premium templates](http://connections-pro.com/templates/).
* Displaying your entries on the front end is as simple as putting a shortcode on a page. Don't let this simplicity fool you. The Connections shortcode provides almost a dizzying array of options that are just too numerous to list. But if you want to know more, you can find it [here](http://connections-pro.com/documentation/plugin/shortcodes/).
* Even a bit of SEO was sprinkled in. Every entry outputs following the [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) spec.

= 8.1.6 01/21/2015 =
* BUG: Fixed the “Warning: Cannot use a scalar value as an array” error. This error was shown to users when their web host does not have an image processing library installed on the web server. This error should no longer be shown, however, Connections will not be able to dynamically resize images. A notice in the admin will still be displayed, “The server does not have ImageMagick or GD installed and/or enabled. Either of these are required for WordPress to be able to resize images. Please contact your server administrator.” If you see this notice, you will have to contact your web host and request that they install the GD image processing library.
* BUG: White screen when uploading an image. This, I believe, is being caused by an older version of the Imagick image processing library. The older version does not contain a required function and will cause a fatal error when Connections tries to use it. This causes the white screen. To address this, Connections no longer uses that function.
* BUG: Fix bug with image URL/s when the protocol is https so they are served securely.

* BUG: Show the edit entry admin bar link if the entry status is approved or pending if the user has either edit or edit moderated capabilities.
* BUG: Fix undefined index errors.
* TWEAK: Add input attribute accept=”image/*” to both the image and logo upload fields.
* TWEAK: Ensure that the path and URL to images are updated to the current path to account for moving sites or changing the site’s folder structure.
* TWEAK: Ensure sub dir is prefixed with a forward slash in cnUpload::subDirectory(). Since it is now being prepended with a forward slash both path and url needed to be untrailingslashit() so the paths are correct when the two are joined with subdir(). This was done to remain consistent with WP core.
* TWEAK: Prevent selection of files that are too large to be uploaded.
* TWEAK: Add actions/filters to cnImage::upload().
* TWEAK: Ensure other plugins can not override the upload path in cnUpload::File().
