Quite simply, Connections Business Directory is the [best directory plugin available](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/connections?filter=5) for WordPress. Its simplicity in design and function, vast array of unique features and versatility are the reasons more and more people are turning to Connections for their directory needs. You can use Connections to create a simple address book, maintain a staff or member directory and run a business directory or link directory. Connections was built bottom up to be as configurable as possible while providing the features you need. Read on to learn about some of the best features Connections has to offer...

= Features =

* **Seamless integration** with WordPress.
* **[Highly rated support.](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/connections?filter=5)**

* Dashboard admin page where you can see at a glance today's anniversaries and birthdays as well as upcoming anniversaries and birthdays of members in your directory.
* Multiple entry types from which to choose; such as individual, organization and family. The family entry type is unique to Connections. This entry type allows you to group individuals together as a family which makes Connections ideally suited for creating a church directory.
* You control which entries are viewable to the public and which entries are private, viewable for logged in users only. You can even have entries set as unlisted so only admins can view them.
* **[Repeatable fields](http://connections-pro.com/documentation/add-entry/#Repeatable_Fields)** for address, phone numbers, email, IM, social media, links and dates.
* Hierarchical (nested) **category support**. Businesses and members in your directory can be added to any number of categories.
* Include a biographical text for an individual member or business description for each entry in your directory using an easy to use rich text editor.
* You can easily add a business logo or photo of the staff member for each entry in your directory. The photo and logo images are fully responsive with **HiDPI (Retina) display support**.
* **Scalable,** manage directories which [contain hundreds of thousands of entries](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/scales-to-at-least-250000-entries).
* **[CSV Export](http://connections-pro.com/documentation/tools/#Export)** of addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and dates.
* **[CSV Import](http://connections-pro.com/documentation/tools/#Categories-2)** of **nested** categories.
* **[Role capability support](http://connections-pro.com/documentation/roles/)**.
* Displaying your entries on the frontend is as simple as putting a shortcode on a page. Don't let this simplicity fool you. The shortcode provides a dizzying array of options that are just too numerous to list. To learn more, [go here](http://connections-pro.com/documentation/plugin/shortcodes/).
* **SEO.** Every entry outputs following the [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard) spec. Soon to be updated to following Schema.org.
* **[Extensible](http://connections-pro.com/extensions/)** and developer friendly.
* Robust **templating support** with the [Template Customizer](http://connections-pro.com/2015/07/27/feature-preview-template-customizer/). Several basic templates are provided to get you started with many more [premium templates available](http://connections-pro.com/templates/).

= How do I display the business directory on my site? =
We have a [QuickStart](http://connections-pro.com/quickstart/) available that'll walk you thru the most basic setup. Basically all you need to do is, create a page, and add the `[connections]` shortcode and then start adding entries to your directory.

Connections Business Directory has been designed to work with any theme.

= Is Connections Business Directory translation-ready? =
Yes it is. Connections Business Directory comes with many user supplied translations. We use Transifex to manage translations. This service make it easy for us manage and easy for you to translate. To read more, see [this page](http://connections-pro.com/documentation/translation/).

= Is Connections Business Directory compatible with WordPress Multisite? =
Yes it is. However, do not Network activate Connections. Activate it on only the subsites that you wish to use Connections.

= Is it possible to share entries with other sites within a WordPress Multisite installation? =
Yes this is possible but there is a special setup required to do so. It is recommended this is done before added entries to your business directory.

1. Activate Connections the primary site.
2. Add `define( 'CN_MULTISITE_ENABLED', FALSE );` to your `wp-config.php` file. **NOTE:** If you have added any entries to any of your subsites, that data will be lost as Connections will read the directory entry data from the primary site's database tables.
