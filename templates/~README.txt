If you would like to tweak one of the following core templates to better suit your needs
please follow the following steps to ensure you will not lose your modifications when
updating Connections.

1. Copy or move  the folder of the template your are going to modify
to the `../wp-content/plugins/` folder.

2. Change the name of the folder. The exact name is not important but it
should descriptive to remind you of the purpose of the files within the folder.
It is suggested prefixing the folder name with "connections-" and add "-template"
as the folder name suffix.

For example, if you are moving the `card` template folder to the `../wp-content/plugins/` folder,
it is recommended to name the folder from `card` to `connections-card-template`.

3. Navigate to the Plugins admin page.

4. Activate the template. It will now override the core template.
